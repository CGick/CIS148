You will work with a partner to create a database that stores the data for a mock application.  First, you will choose your application, write a description of what the application does, and then create mocked-up screens for it. Consider carefully what data entities would be needed to support the application.

40 points: Provide mock-up of app and its various screens. Provide a written description of what your app does and who uses your app.

Create a  for the database. Make sure it is normalized to at least the 3rd level. Create an EER diagram using MySQL Workbench.

With your partner, decide on 4 types of data presentations or reports that a user or owner of your application would find useful.  Write a use case for each of them. Aim for a creative, challenging, and useful report.  Divide the reports, each person must write 2 of the reports and will earn individual grades on these reports. Each partner must write at least one query that joins multiple tables and one query that uses an aggregate function).

40 points: (Each person) Write code for 2 reports each (must join multiple tables in a query and use aggregate functions in a query).

With your partner, you will present your app idea, database, and reports to the classroom. There will be a Q&A where you may have to write DML queries against your database.

40 points: Presentation/demonstration, question and answer. DML on the spot.
